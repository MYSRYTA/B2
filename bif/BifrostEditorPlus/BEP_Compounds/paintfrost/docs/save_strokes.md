Compound for conveniently writing stroke data to a file.

The output is a 2d array of stroke steps. A stroke step is a single instance of a stroke, an array of steps represents an entire stroke. So the output is an array of strokes (which itself is an array).

The usage and file saving/loading operation is very similar to the scene_data compound.
